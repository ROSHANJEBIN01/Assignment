	<p><b><font color="blue">A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</font><b></p><hr>
	<h2 align="center"><b><i><u>C</u><sup>++</sup></i><b></h2>
	<p><font color="blue">C++ (pronounced cee plus plus) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</font></p><hr>
	<h2 align="center"><b><u><i>C</i></u><b></h2>
	<p><font color="blue">C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</font></p><hr>
	<h2 align="center"><b><u><i>Java</i></u><b></h2>
	<p><font color="blue">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</font></p><hr>
