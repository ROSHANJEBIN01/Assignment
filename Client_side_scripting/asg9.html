<h2><i><u><a id="1">COMPUTER</a></u></i></h2>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit, and some form of memory. </p>
<h4><u><a id="2">CPU</a></u></h4>
<p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the computer component that's responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the computer's other hardware and software.Intel and AMD are the two most popular CPU manufacturers for desktops, laptops, and servers, while Apple, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm are big smartphone and tablet CPU makers.</p>
<h4><u><a id="3">ALU</a></u></h4>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.</p>
<h2><i><u><a id="4">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</a></u></i></h2>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
<h4><u><a id="5">C</a></u></h4>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</p>
<h4><u><a id="6">Java</a></u></h4>
<p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation</p>
<h2><i><u><a id="7">DBMS</a></u></i></h2>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p>A Database is a collection of records. Database management systems are designed as the means of managing all the records. Database Management is a software system that uses a standard method and running queries with some of them designed for the oversight and proper control of databases.</p>
<h4><u><a id="8">RDBMS</a></u></h4>
<p>A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd. Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use. </p>
<h4><u><a id="9">OODBMS</a></u></h4>
<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</p>
<h4><u><a id="10">HDBMS</a></u></h4>
<p>HDBMS stands for Hierarchical Data Base Management System. A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. In a hierarchical database, records contain information about there groups of parent/child relationships, just like as a tree structure. The structure implies that a record can have also a repeating information.</p>
<h4><u><a id="11">NWDBMS</a></u></h4>
<p>A NDBMS (Network Database Management System) is a type of DBMS system that supports the network data model. Network databases are mainly used on a large digital computers. Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases by also having a hierarchical structure. A network database looks more like a cobweb or interconnected network of records.</p>
