<h1><font color="Red"><u><i>The Universe</i></u></font></h1>
<p><font color="darkblue">The universe is commonly defined as everything that exists. It includes all kinds of physical matter and energy, the planets, stars, galaxies, and all the contents of space. Astronomers can use telescopes to look at very distant galaxies. Like this they see what the universe looked like a long time ago. This is because the light from distant parts of the universe takes a very long time to reach us. From these observations, it seems the physical laws and constants of the universe have not changed. Physicists are currently unsure if anything existed before the Big Bang. They are also unsure whether the size of the universe is infinite.</font> </p>
<h3><font color="grey">History</font></h3>
<p><font color="darkblue">Many people in history had ideas to explain the universe. Most early models had the Earth at the centre of the Universe. Some ancient Greeks thought that the Universe has infinite space and has existed forever. They thought it had a set of spheres which corresponded to the fixed stars, the Sun and various planets. The spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving Earth.

Over the centuries, better observations and better ideas of gravity led to Copernicus's Sun-centred model. This was hugely controversial at the time, and was fought long and hard by authorities of the Christian church (see Giordano Bruno and Galileo).

The invention of the telescope in the Netherlands, 1608, was a milestone in astronomy. By the mid-19th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished. The modern optical (uses visible light) telescope is still more advanced. Meanwhile, the Newtonian dynamics (equations) showed how the Solar System worked.

The improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realise that the Solar System is in a galaxy made of billions of stars, the Milky Way, and that other galaxies exist outside it, as far as we can see. Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to much of modern cosmology. Discovery of the redshift showed that the Universe is expanding.</font></p>
<h3><font color="grey">Big Bang</font></h3>
<p><font color="darkblue">The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the Big Bang theory. The Universe expanded from a very hot, dense phase called the Planck epoch, in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated. Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and, more generally, the Big Bang idea. Recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of dark energy. Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present methods. This has been named dark matter.

Just to be clear, dark matter and energy have not been detected directly (that is why they are called 'dark'). Their existence is inferred by deduction from observations which would be difficult to explain otherwise.

Current thinking in cosmology is that the age of the Universe is 13.73 (± 0.12) billion years, and that the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion light years, or 8.80 ×1026 metres.

According to general relativity, space can get bigger faster than the speed of light, but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light. We cannot see space beyond the limitations of light (or any electromagnetic radiation).</font></p>
